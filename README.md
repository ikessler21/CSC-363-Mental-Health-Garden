# CSC-363-Mental-Health-Garden
Welcome to the Garden Project! This is a mental health aid that runs on a web platform, 
with a mood tracker journal function, as well as a garden that you, the user, can take care of.

To run this program, download the entire repositor, open the moodtracker.html file, and click run.

We hope you enjoy.
